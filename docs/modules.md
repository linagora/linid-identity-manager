# Modules Overview

The `modules.json` file is used to declare and configure the front-end modules available in **Linid Identity Manager**.
Each module provides a specific feature, and you can activate or deactivate them depending on your organization’s needs.

Modules can be customized to match your company:

- Data displayed
- Screen layout and behavior
- Visual style or branding
- Optional features based on your workflow

The goal is to offer a flexible system that adapts to each environment.

## 🛠️ Planned Modules

Several modules are currently planned and will be added in future versions:

- **User Management Module** — Manage users, their profiles and assignments.
- **Group Management Module** — Manage organizational groups.
- **Building Management Module** — Manage company buildings and related data.
- **User Roles & Functions Module** — Manage job roles, positions, and user functions.
- **User Add-On Modules** — Optional extensions that add complementary views or features to the User Module.

Modules may depend on one another.
For example, a _User Add-On Module_ requires the _User Management Module_ to be enabled first.
